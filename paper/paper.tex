\emph{The set-based approach.} %
%
Many real-world problems require the resolution of ODEs with uncertainties such as: initial conditions or applied loads. %
%
Obtaining solutions considering these uncertainties is a challenging task, particularly in large scale systems.
%
The set-based approach consists in the construction of sets that contain all the feasible solutions of the ODEs. %

\emph{Solid Dynamics ODEs.} %
%
In problems such as wave propagation or structural vibrations, solid dynamics problems are formulated. %
%
In these cases, large systems of ODEs of the form:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:second_order}
\mathbf{M} \mathbf{x}''(t) + \mathbf{C}\mathbf{x}'(t) + \mathbf{K}\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{F}(t),
\end{equation}
%
are formulated using the Finite-Element Method (FEM)~\cite{Bathe2014}, where $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the displacements (or state) vector, and $\mathbf{M}$, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ are the mass, damping and stiffness matrices, respectively. Depending on the problem $n$ is typically  between $10^2$ and $10^5$.

\emph{Set-based Solid dynamics.} %
%
When uncertainty is present in the initial conditions, the displacements and velocities can be considered in sets as: $\mathbf{x}(0) \in \mathcal{X}_0$ and $\mathbf{x}'(0) \in \mathcal{V}_0$. %
%
In \cite{forets2021combining} a novel approach for time integration of structural dynamics equations based on set-based techniques~\cite{althoff2020set} is presented. %
%
This approach allows to compute in a single integration the solution sets (or \emph{flowpipes}) that include all exact trajectories for uncertainties in initial conditions and applied loads. %
%

\emph{Set-based FEM implementation and application.} %
%
In order to apply the set-based approach for solid dynamics, the package \href{http://github.com/JuliaReach/ReachabilityAnalysis.jl}{ReachabilityAnalysis.jl}\cite{ReachabilityAnalysis} was extended, providing a simple interface that can also be connected with FEM analysis tools such as \href{http://onsas.org}{ONSAS}~\cite{onsas}.
%
The implementations developed can be used to solve large systems, however, in this abstract a minimal didactic problem is solved. %
%
A system of two masses loaded with a Heaviside step function as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagram} is considered.

\noindent \emph{Solution method.} To illustrate the flexibility of our approach, two algorithm choices are considered, both relying on support functions~\cite{LeGuernic2010250} (\texttt{LGG09} algorithm in Lines 8-9).
%
\texttt{solA} contains the flowpipe efficiently computed along box directions $\pm e_1 = [\pm 1, 0, 0, 0]^T$, while \texttt{solB} contains the projection of the flowpipe for displacement coordinates of each mass. To improve the accuracy, the latter method uses octagonal template directions.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent \emph{Perspectives.} We envision to model variations in mass and stiffness parameters using interval methods~\cite{forets2021intervalmat, ferranti2021interval}.
%
Probabilistic reachability, and modeling nonlinear behaviors using state-space abstraction methods, are also planned.
%
Julia has a thriving ecosystem of open source FEM projects~\cite{Gridap,Ferrite,FinEtools}, and we think that integrating set propagation into such tools is the next key step for solving real world problems using reachability.
